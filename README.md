## Overview

SmartSquares is an enthralling memory-based game that tests your cognitive abilities while offering an addictive gameplay experience. Developed meticulously in Kotlin, the game brings a unique blend of concentration, memory, and quick reflexes, all wrapped up in a visually appealing interface.

## How to Play

As soon as you enter the game, a grid fills with colored sticks that flash on the screen for 1.5 seconds before disappearing. Your task is simple yet challenging: Remember where the sticks appeared.

1. **Initial Glance**: Once you start a new game, the sticks show up randomly across the grid for 1.5 seconds. Pay close attention; you'll need to remember their locations.
  
2. **The Memory Test**: After the sticks vanish, you'll have to tap on the grid where you remember seeing them.

3. **The 'HINT' Button**: If you find yourself in a tough spot, pressing the 'HINT' button makes the sticks reappear for another 1.5 seconds. Use this sparingly; it's your lifeline!

## Scoring

- Each correct tap earns you points.
- Keep an eye on your score; the game becomes progressively challenging.

## Hard Zone

Reach a score of 850 points, and you enter the 'Hard Zone', an arena where your memory skills are pushed to the limit. The game speeds up, the grid becomes more complex, and your journey to become a SmartSquares legend continues.
